# Dynamic Programming
The Dynamic Programming is one of the different algorithm paradigms. In this approach, the problems can be divided into some sub-problems and it stores the output of some previous sub-problems to use them in future. This algorithmic technique helps to reduce the computational time for the task hence used for solving an optimization problem.
